$ curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot266721295:AAG39D0MCOVVHBFp32-y624Pb7PtHU6z6FM/sendMessage?chat_id=[CHAT_ID]&text=Hello%20World"
```

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.telegram.org/bot266721295:AAG39D0MCOVVHBFp32-y624Pb7PtHU6z6FM/sendMessage"

querystring = {"chat_id":"[CHAT_ID]","text":"Hello%20World"}

response = requests.request("GET", url, params=querystring)

print(response.text)
```

* Go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"io/ioutil"
)

func main() {

	url := "https://api.telegram.org/bot266721295:AAG39D0MCOVVHBFp32-y624Pb7PtHU6z6FM/sendMessage?chat_id=-1001064749324&text=Hello%2520World"

	req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)

	res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

	defer res.Body.Close()
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

	fmt.Println(res)
	fmt.Println(string(body))
